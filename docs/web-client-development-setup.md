## Updating OpenAPI Client Using `openapi-ts`

The OpenAPI client in the web client is automatically generated by [openapi-ts](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts). This tool generates clients based on the specifications in [the central server's openapi.json file](http://localhost:8081/api/openapi.json). When new routes are added to the central server, or existing routes are modified, you might have to regenerate the client. To do so, simply run the following code in the `WebClient/` directory:

```bash
npm run clientgen  # For NPM users
bun run clientgen  # For Bun users
```
