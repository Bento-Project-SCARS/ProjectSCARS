# Project SCARS

Project SCARS is a School Canteen Automated Reporting System for the Department
of Education (DepEd) Schools Division Office (SDO) of the City of Baliwag in
the Philippines.

The web client is written in TypeScript using the Next.js framework. It
is the user-facing application that allows canteen managers to submit
their monthly financial reports to the central server. The web client
also optionally communicates with the local server to provide inventory
and sales functionality.
